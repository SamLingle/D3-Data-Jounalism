          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Poverty level and Obesity</h2>
          <p>Having read a study into the socioeconomics of weight linking communitites with higher poverty levels with
            higher obesity rates, I was excited to get a chance to explore the data myself.
          a more obese population. This chart suprised me by showing a weaker correlation between the two 
          variables than I had originally thought considering that none of the records show a state 
          with an obese population of under 20%. </p>

          <p>You can see that a higher rate of poverty generally correlates with a higher level of obesity. But the state with the least poverty (New Hampshire) had an obesity level of 27.4. 
            WHile the state with the highest poverty percentage (Mississippi) has an obesity level of 35%. In total a 7.6% percent change in obesity to a 12.3% change 
            in population under the poverty level. In addition there are outliers. Such as Deleware which boasts
            a 12.5% poverty rate, but a 30.7% obesity rate. Or Indiana with 15.2% poverty and 32.7% obese population recorded. What this tells me 
            is that though higher levels of poverty tend to mean higher levels of obesity, there are likely other factors that go into 
            the amount of obese people within a population. Such as food choices, available exercize habits, and modes of transportation to name a few.
